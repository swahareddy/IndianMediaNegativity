The statement, which contradicts the Indian Council of Medical Researchs plan to launch a vaccine by 15 August this year, was a part of an article written by TV Venkateswaran, a scientist at Vigyan Prasar, an autonomous organisation under the Union governments department of science and technology.Speaking to Firstpost, Venkateswaran said that while the statement was a part of the original article, the line was removed as the year was not the point of the article.Venkateswaran told Firstpost, The main purpose of the article was to explain in simple language how the two vaccines that are being developed in India (COVAXIN and ZyCov-D) work. When I said that the vaccines will not be available before 2021, it was a statement that was based on certain facts. Even if we have a drug today, we would need about 12 crore doses of it in order for it to reach even 10 percent of the population. One cannot produce 12 crore doses of a drug merely by waving a magic wand. In that sense, the statement in the article was a very ordinary one. However, the PIB most likely thought that such a firm statement might unnecessarily confuse the public, and so they edited it out.However, in the original article, the statement in question was not made in the context of the challenges in producing a certain number of doses of the vaccine. The paragraph before the line in question had mentioned that globally, 140 vaccines against COVID-19 are under various stages of development.In the next paragraph, the author spoke about the scenario in India. He wrote, Parallelly, Indian institutions have also engaged in R&D for the development of vaccines in India. With the primary scientific inputs coming from institutions like Pune based ICMR Institution, National Institute of Virology and Hyderabad based CSIR institution Center for Cellular and Molecular Biology, six Indian companies are working on a vaccine for COVID-19. Along with the two Indian vaccines, COVAXIN and ZyCov-D, the world over, 11 out of 140 vaccine candidates have entered the human trials. None of these vaccines is unlikely to be ready for mass use before 2021. (sic)On 4 July, Venkateswaran also wrote an article on the news website The Federal, in which he spoke in detail about the process of conducting the clinical trial of COVAXIN. He wrote, The public information available in the Clinical Trial Registry of India (CTRI) indicates that the follow ups of the trial will be carried on Day 14, Day 28, Day 104 and Day 194, that is about six months. The whole effort may take a year and three months according to the submission made by Bharat Biotech.Elaborating on the\\xa0above statement, Venkateswaran told Firstpost, If Bharat Biotech (which is developing the vaccine) says that the process will take a year and three months, who am I to counter or question it? I have no role in that.At the heart on the ongoing controversy is a letter written by the ICMR to Bharat Biotech on 2 July, in which it stated that it is envisaged to launch the vaccine for public health use latest by 15 August. Several experts have questioned whether a vaccine launched at such a short deadline would compromise standards of safety and efficacy.As of now, Bharat Biotech have not commented on whether it is feasible to launch the vaccine on 15 August, instead of the original deadline of one year and three months. However, speaking to Firstpost, Dr Chandrasekhar Gillurkar, one of the investigators in the clinical trial, said, It will be difficult to finish the trials by 15 August. However, the results of Phase 1 of the trial, and a general inclination of the results of Phase 2 can become known by that date. The government can get an initial idea about the safety and immunogenicity (ability of a foreign substance to provoke an immune response in the human body) of the vaccine by that deadline. Even after 15 August, the various processes involved in the trial will go on.When asked whether it would be correct to claim that the vaccine would be ready for public health use by 15 August, Gillurkar said, No, it is difficult to say that. However, once we submit our report, the government will take a decision on what action to take on it. Everything depends on what the results of the clinical trials will be.Coronavirus Updates: According to a state health department bulletin, over 1.98 lakh patients have been discharged till date and the recovery rate stands at 54.02 percentA day after the ICMR announced that it aims to launch a COVID-19 vaccine by 15 August, it issued a clarification saying the process to expedite trials was in accordance with normsThe Phase I and Phase II clinical trials of the vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, approved after pre-clinical studies demonstrated safety and immune response, would start across the country next month.While the ICMR has said it is important to expedite the clinical trials for a promising indigenous vaccine in the public interest and that all other vaccine candidates across the globe have been similarly fast-tracked, scientists in one voice have cautioned against being over-optimisticOn the recommendation of MHA, MEITY has issued orders under Sec. 69 A of the I.T. Act, 2000, for blocking 40 websites of SFJ, a home ministry spokesperson said.More than 1,000 doctors, nurses and paramedics of the ITBP and other Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs), and another 1,000 paramedics, assistants and security staff have been deployed at the facility in Delhi for its smooth operation.The administration has announced a compensation of Rs 4 lakh each for the families of the dead workers. The injured will be given Rs 50,000 each.While the ICMR has said it is important to expedite the clinical trials for a promising indigenous vaccine in the public interest and that all other vaccine candidates across the globe have been similarly fast-tracked, scientists in one voice have cautioned against being over-optimisticA virologist said that a vaccine normally takes at least 12-18 months to pass all necessary clinical trial phases while the company developing it has just over a month to wrap up everythingBharat Biotech has passed mandated protocols, animal testing and is now in clinical development of Covid vaccine, Dr Krishna Ella tells FirstpostHyderabad-based Bharat Biotech, one of seven Indian companies involved in the indigenous production of a vaccine for the novel coronavirus, received the green signal from the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) to begin human trials of Covaxin last week.The ICMR envisages launching the vaccine for public health use by 15 August after completion of all clinical trials, as per a letter to institutions conducting trials.Dr Anant Bhan, a researcher in global health, bioethics and health policy and former president of International Association of Bioethics, spoke to Firstpost about the extreme urgency shown by ICMR in developing Indias COVID-19 vaccine, COVAXIN, by 15 August', '2020-07-05 17:33:25', -0.200000003, 11.5, '/Law & Government/Public Safety', 0.930000007, '/Health/Medical Facilities & Services/Medical Procedures', 0.879999995, '2020-07-05 20:35:50.648308', '2020-07-05 20:35:50.648310', 'Firstpost2020-07-05 17:33:25PIB uploads article claiming none of six Indian comp..ve it ready before 2021, later removes mention of year - Firstpost', 'https://www.firstpost.com/health/pib-uploads-article-claiming-none-of-six-indian-companies-working-on-covid-19-vaccine-will-have-it-ready-before-2021-later-removes-mention-of-year-8561511.html')\n",

Globally, over 100 candidates are being tested on humans but no vaccine has yet been approved.Speaking to Firstpost, Bharat Biotech chairman Dr Krishna Ella, said said that COVAXIN was reported to be safe and immunogenic in all animals. We have now moved forward towards the clinical development of this vaccine, he added.According to PTI, Zydus said that is planning to initiate the clinical trials in July 2020 across multiple sites in India in over 1,000 subjects, however, the company did not say when the vaccine will be ready for commercial use, unlike Covaxin, which is targeting for release on 15 August.The vaccine candidate, ZyCoV-D, showed a strong immune response in animal studies, and the antibodies produced were able to completely neutralise the wild type virus, Zydus said.Coronavirus Updates: Maharashtra reported the biggest single-day spike of 5,493 COVID-19 cases so far on Sunday, which took the tally of patients in the state to 1,64,626.Fans will have their temperature checked and will need to wear face masks when they are eventually allowed back into football stadiums in Spain, according to protocol guidelines sent to clubs.Coronavirus Updates: RJD MLA Shahnawaz Alam has tested positive for COVID-19, the fourth legislator in Bihar to have contracted the disease.While the ICMR has said it is important to expedite the clinical trials for a promising indigenous vaccine in the public interest and that all other vaccine candidates across the globe have been similarly fast-tracked, scientists in one voice have cautioned against being over-optimisticOn the recommendation of MHA, MEITY has issued orders under Sec. 69 A of the I.T.

An infected person will have\\xa0specific antibodies\\xa0to pathogens they have been exposed to. The\\xa0immune system\\xa0produces antibodies as part of a larger process to defend itself from an infection.That said, antibody tests may not be able to show whether the virus is currently infecting the body.\\xa0Unlike a nasal or throat swab test, which looks for genetic signatures of the virus\\xa0in the body,\\xa0an antibody test looks for\\xa0traces of the bodys\\xa0response to the virus.Antibodies are abundant in the blood,\\xa0so a sample of blood is\\xa0collected\\xa0by either a finger prick or\\xa0a blood sample drawn with a needle. Two specific\\xa0antibody types are sought out in an antibody test:At\\xa0the community\\xa0and national levels,\\xa0widespread antibody testing\\xa0gives\\xa0researchers and authorities estimates of the rate of\\xa0infection (how quickly the virus is spreading in a population), and how fatal COVID-19 is. This data\\xa0informs important decisions around\\xa0testing,\\xa0prevention, and treatment of\\xa0COVID-19.Along with other information collected from patients in hospitals, antibody testing can also offer information on\\xa0what factors affect the severity of infection, and why some people are more severely impacted than others.Vaccines are developed under the principle that a shot\\xa0imitates a mild case of the infection itself, and once injected, it helps the\\xa0immune system mount a stronger attack against a pathogen when it does attack.\\xa0This offers some protection from a full-scale attack of COVID-19.\\xa0Antibodies are made more quickly and copiously as part of this vaccine-enabled response.Margin of error:\\xa0Antibody tests are important for establishing who has had the virus, especially because\\xa0a percentage of\\xa0people infected seem to show no symptoms. An antibody test can give results in under an hour.\\xa0For instance, the ICMR-approved antibody testing kits show results within 30 minutes.\\xa0The test\\xa0can be used 7 to 10 days after someone\\xa0is infected, but do have a larger percentage of error than swab tests.Antibody tests\\xa0that look for IgM antibodies are usually rapid finger prick tests that can deliver results in\\xa0under 20 minutes. But\\xa0IgG tests require a blood sample to be sent to a lab – a process that could take\\xa0a week to deliver\\xa0results. IgG tests are\\xa0more reliable than IgM rapid tests, but dont reveal as much information about someones COVID-19 infection.False negatives and false positive:\\xa0The many diagnostic kits in circulation currently are a necessity – but they are also products of fast-track approval and developing research into COVID-19, where\\xa0the priority\\xa0is\\xa0public health demand and speed.Considering the developing nature of ongoing COVID-19 research,\\xa0there is no assurance of quality, or guarantee that a test result is 100 percent accurate.\\xa0Some kits will perform better than others.There\\xa0may be\\xa0cases where exposure to COVID-19 isnt followed by the production of antibodies\\xa0in an individual, showing up as a false negative. Tests that\\xa0arent of high-quality may also\\xa0show a false positive\\xa0if an individual\\xa0has another, very similar virus in\\xa0the body.Currently, ICMR is the authority recommending the most suitable kit for widespread antibody testing after making these due considerations.\\xa0A\\xa0report in the\\xa0Hindu\\xa0highlights\\xa0multiple instances of quality assurance of\\xa0testing kits being severely lacking.Doctors can examine the blood of COVID-19 patients to identify those at greatest risk of severe illness and to pinpoint those most likely to need a ventilator. Image credit: U.S. Marine Corps/Pfc. Stephen CampbellOverwhelming inaccuracies in testing asymptomatics:\\xa0There have been\\xa0a few dozen studies that measure\\xa0the accuracy of antibody tests compared with a reference standard\\xa0to detect an ongoing or past COVID-19 infection. In a review of these studies, authors found that\\xa0antibody tests one week after the first symptoms appeared only detected 30 percent of\\xa0positive COVID-19 cases. The accuracy increased in\\xa0the second\\xa0week, with 70 percent of cases detected.\\xa0It was highest in\\xa0the third week, with\\xa0over\\xa090 percent of cases detected.We know that it\\xa0takes anywhere between 1-3 weeks to develop antibodies after symptoms occur, which\\xa0makes the test as good as a coinflip in\\xa0people who\\xa0dont show symptoms.False sense of security:\\xa0While this isnt a challenge of antibody tests exclusively, it is one that needs to be considered. On getting a positive\\xa0COVID-19 antibody test,\\xa0a person may very well think that having COVID-19 antibodies\\xa0gives them\\xa0immune to the virus and wont catch it again. There is currently no evidence to suggest that people who have recovered from COVID-19 are immune to catching it again.Even\\xa0if studies show\\xa0antibodies\\xa0are found to\\xa0offer immunity,\\xa0it is\\xa0difficult to establish\\xa0how much antibody is needed to\\xa0offer this protection,\\xa0or how long the protection might last. Scientists world over are\\xa0carrying out research\\xa0studies to answer these questions.There\\xa0are also rapid tests\\xa0in use in some countries to diagnose active COVID-19 cases,\\xa0since the tests would be much quicker and less invasive than the current swabs. The two kinds of rapid tests being used in India\\xa0currently are the antigen test and RT-PCR test.Antigen\\xa0tests\\xa0seek out\\xa0specific proteins only found in the virus, which the\\xa0bodys immune response recognises as foreign.\\xa0Most\\xa0COVID-19 antigen tests target the\\xa0spike protein that studs the surface of the coronavirus.The structure and cross-sectional view of Human Coronavirus. It shows depicting the shape of coronavirus as well as the cross-sectional view. Image credit: WikipediaA\\xa0swab from the nose is collected for this test, where theres a high likelihood of virus particles being present. The swab is then dipped in a solution that\\xa0inactivates\\xa0the virus, and\\xa0then\\xa0transferred\\xa0onto a test strip.\\xa0The test strip\\xa0houses antibodies that bind to coronavirus proteins and hold them in place as the fluid spreads.One of the major advantages of using antigen\\xa0is that it reduces the burden of relying on just RT-PCR tests to identify COVID-19 patients.Antigen testing is useful because even if its less sensitive, it is rapid and the results that are positive will be positive, Dr Gagandeep Kang, executive director of the Transnational Health Service and Technology Institute, told thePrint\\xa0in an interview. So, patients who test positive can get into isolation faster.Since antigen testing doesnt involve any processes of amplifying the virus or its genetic material,\\xa0a swab sample may have too little\\xa0antigen to be detected. This\\xa0could produce\\xa0a\\xa0false negative result. As a precaution, a negative test should be followed up by\\xa0the more accurate RT-PCR test,\\xa0to confirm\\xa0a true negative for COVID-19.A PCR test is a widely-used,\\xa0highly\\xa0sensitive test that\\xa0seeks out\\xa0traces of genetic material\\xa0from a specific\\xa0pathogen, if\\xa0the pathogen\\xa0is present\\xa0in the body.\\xa0The technique\\xa0is a powerful diagnostic tool that can\\xa0identify both DNA or RNA from specific microorganisms, irrespective of whether\\xa0they are bacteria or viruses.A PCR\\xa0can capture a specific gene from\\xa0genetic material (DNA or RNA)\\xa0in\\xa0a swab sample, and multiply it through a series of chemical processes so it can be detected using fluorescent dyes.While some viruses have only DNA, others like SARS-CoV-2, only contain RNA. Viruses\\xa0infect a healthy cell and hack into the natural\\xa0machinery that cells use to process our own RNA,\\xa0so the virus particle\\xa0can multiply and survive.\\xa0Once inside\\xa0a cell, the virus uses its RNA\\xa0to take control of the cells machinery and ‘reprogramme\\xa0the cell into a virus-making factory.To detect an RNA virus\\xa0like SARS-CoV-2, scientists use\\xa0an enzyme (reverse transcriptase)\\xa0to convert the viruss RNA into DNA, in a simple and widely-used one-step process\\xa0called ‘reverse transcription. This\\xa0allows a single\\xa0molecule of\\xa0DNA\\xa0to be\\xa0amplified\\xa0exponentially (millions of times), which is the\\xa0main goal of the\\xa0PCR process, so even virus particles in single digits can be detected in the final result.An RT-PCR test is considered\\xa0very reliable because it\\xa0can detect\\xa0even\\xa0a single virus particle in swabs taken from inside the mouth or nose, where the virus particles are most prevalent.Swift, sensitive and specific:\\xa0There are real-time variations of the RT–PCR technique\\xa0that are quick,\\xa0super sensitive, and specific.\\xa0They can deliver a reliable diagnosis in three\\xa0hours. That said, the\\xa0process on average takes around eight hours\\xa0to produce\\xa0a conclusive result.More accurate, less prone to contamination:\\xa0Compared to other methods to isolate and detect viruses, RT–PCR is\\xa0much faster and less likely to be\\xa0contaminated or cause errors during the testing process.\\xa0This is\\xa0because the\\xa0test – start to finish – is\\xa0carried out\\xa0in\\xa0an enclosed tube, inside a specialised, automated machine.Severity of infection can be estimated:\\xa0A standard real-time RT–PCR set-up usually goes through 35 cycles, which means that, by the end of the process, around 35 billion new copies of the sections of viral DNA are created from each strand of the virus present in the sample.Only\\xa0detects\\xa0ongoing infection:\\xa0The main limitation of RT-PCR testing is that it\\xa0cannot be used to detect a past infection with SARS-CoV-2, which is important for understanding the development and spread of the virus, as viruses are only present in the body for a specific window of time.Other methods are necessary to detect, track and study past infections, particularly those which may have developed and spread without symptoms. Once you have recovered, the virus is eliminated and these tests can no longer tell if youve been infected. This creates significant uncertainty, especially if someone has self-isolated due to mild and unclear symptoms.Requires specialised equipment, training:\\xa0Unlike antibody testing, which requires a kit and medical/paramedical personnel trained in using the kit, RT-PCR testing needs specific instruments in a laboratory,\\xa0which\\xa0makes it\\xa0more time-consuming. Even if the test itself takes\\xa0just a few hours, the process of collecting and labeling samples, transporting them to a lab, and processing the samples in bulk\\xa0ensure that it is\\xa0days before the results from a single sample are known.Portable, rapid RT-PCR machines are\\xa0at the cutting edge of diagnostic technology, and often require specialised training\\xa0to ensure the machine isnt misused, which requires some level of expertise and training. Tests are only\\xa0now\\xa0being developed and made\\xa0available\\xa0for\\xa0these advanced instruments.Quality control is\\xa0not\\xa0a guarantee:\\xa0In a pandemic, the use of even very accurate diagnostic tools is more error-prone than daily diagnostic tests. RT-PCR, while a\\xa0revolutionary tool in diagnosis,\\xa0can also be easily misused or misinterpreted. It\\xa0depends on a reliable existing\\xa0DNA sample of the virus,\\xa0as a reference, to find the pathogen in a test. It\\xa0is also sensitive enough to\\xa0pick up on contamination as a false positive.Back when the outbreak first began to spread in India, the National Institute of Virology in Pune was the only laboratory testing for COVID-19. Today, there are 1,000.\\xa0The validity and accuracy of a test depend entirely on the laboratorys quality.\\xa0The Hindu\\xa0reports\\xa0multiple instances of private and public testing labs (including quality assurance labs) returning false positives at an alarming rate.\\xa0Experts have\\xa0called for\\xa0internal quality control and external quality assessment as an urgent requirement\\xa0if PCR testing is to be considered reliable.Most modern PCR tests\\xa0can\\xa0detect\\xa0a wide range of pathogens\\xa0in real-time, with results visible\\xa0as the chain reaction is underway. TrueNat\\xa0is a chip-based, portable RT-PCR machine, originally developed as a portable diagnostic tool for tuberculosis by\\xa0Goa-based startup\\xa0 Molbio Diagnostics.The device is\\xa0on its way\\xa0to becoming one of the\\xa0main diagnostic tools for COVID-19 as India looks to expand its testing capacity. It\\xa0is the fastest available PCR-based technique recommended by ICMR till date.The latest versions of the TrueNat machine\\xa0can detect\\xa0an\\xa0enzyme (called RdRp) found in the RNA of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. The ICMR has ruled that these tests can be treated as a confirmation for the presence of the coronavirus.TrueNat can\\xa0return results faster time than the standard RT-PCR tests, according to Sriram Natarajan, CEO of Molbio Diagnostics.\\xa0But it is\\xa0not as accurate.\\xa0Cases found positive\\xa0in a TrueNat device\\xa0need\\xa0to be reconfirmed\\xa0with traditional RT-PCR testing, as per an ICMR advisory.In a letter shared by\\xa0ANI dated 4 July, ICMR\\xa0has\\xa0advised\\xa0private laboratories in states and Union Territories that intend to use TrueNat for COVID-19 testing to apply for NABL accreditation immediately, to\\xa0ensure reliable results.Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has written to all states/UTs saying that all private laboratories in their state who intend to initiate TrueNat/CBNAAT based testing for #COVID19 should be encouraged to immediately apply for NABL accreditation to ensure quality testing. pic.twitter.com/zm3Xlva3AvMost countries have turned to PCR-based testing because they are reliable and the fastest to develop. Since antibody testing is often\\xa0a\\xa0quicker, inexpensive, and easily-scalable option,\\xa0the number of reported cases climbs steeply as antibody testing is expanded, and gaps in testing\\xa0are addressed.Big differences in testing strategies from country-to-country make the\\xa0net numbers between countries incomparable in any\\xa0real sense. But nationally, standardised procedures and equipment for widespread testing can ensure that consistent data is released.Testing capacity\\xa0continues to be\\xa0a challenge for India considering the scale of the outbreak, the\\xa0rapidly developing nature of the outbreak in some states, the slow evolution of research and reliable test kits, and quality control of testing procedures.Coronavirus Updates: RJD MLA Shahnawaz Alam has tested positive for COVID-19, the fourth legislator in Bihar to have contracted the disease.Coronavirus Updates:Students will be promoted to the next class without any examination but a decision on determination of marks will be taken in the next few days, said Technical Education Minister Subhash GargIn an address during the virtual meeting of the American Association of Physicians of Indian Origin (AAPI) on Saturday, Narendra Modi said that the COVID-19 had been used as an opportunity to work towards making the country self-reliant.While the ICMR has said it is important to expedite the clinical trials for a promising indigenous vaccine in the public interest and that all other vaccine candidates across the globe have been similarly fast-tracked, scientists in one voice have cautioned against being over-optimisticOn the recommendation of MHA, MEITY has issued orders under Sec. 69 A of the I.T.

He used to extort money from people, he added.Police officials claimed that a large team had to be deployed as angry villagers could have attacked Dubeys family. But the situation did not go out of control due to the police presence, Agarwal said.Soon after Senior Superintendent of Police Dinesh Prabhu reached the village, police officials hired a driver who was asked to demolish Dubeys mansion by using an earth mover.\\xa0TV channels also showed visuals of luxury cars in the complex being crushed by the giant machines.\\xa0A 12-ft high boundary wall with barbed wires was also razed.Before the demolition, Dubeys father and a domestic help were evicted from the premises. I have been ailing, so I dont know what has happened. I cant see or hear properly, he said to queries from reporters.According to the villagers, the new house was built about seven year ago and had CCTV cameras at various conspicuous places inside the premises as well as outside the four entry gates and one main gate.Around 80 metres from the main gate, there was a four-room luxurious accommodation where Dubey used to live, which was also demolished.Local police told PTI that Dubey, who had 60 cases against him, maintained a private militia and recruited mostly local youths. He also provided them with weapons, the news\\xa0agency said.A few villagers, when approached, were reluctant to speak. A young girl when asked why many houses in the villages were locked said that most of the people living in the vicinity of her house work in Kanpur, and come to the village on Sundays.Swinging into action after the brutal deaths of the policemen, 25 police teams fanned out across Uttar Pradesh and other states to hunt down Dubey and his associates, officials said.\\xa0 The attackers had fled, snatching weapons from the dead and the wounded policemen.Police officials also said a surveillance team was scanning over 500 mobile phones and frantic efforts were on to retrieve information from the devices.An official indicated that about 30 people were detained for questioning. Another said there was a possibility that Dubey may have fled to Nepal or taken shelter in a neighbouring state.A cash reward of Rs 50,000 has been announced for providing information about Dubey and the identity of the information provider will be kept secret,\\xa0News18\\xa0reported.In view of the allegations levelled against SO, he has been suspended, and all the allegations are being thoroughly looked into. If his involvement or that of any other personnel of the police is found in this incident, then they will be sacked from the department, and also sent to jail, IG Mohit Agarwal told reporters.Hindustan Times,\\xa0quoting sources in the local police department, said the initial investigation hinted that Dubey was well aware about the police raid at his house and prepared to deal with it.Dubey was apparently tipped off by his men in the police department about the force from three police stations Bilhaur, Bithoor and Chaubeypur moving towards his village,\\xa0the\\xa0Hindustan Times\\xa0report said.Dubey had already blocked the main entrance of the village with heavy machines, forcing the police personnel to walk to Dubeys house on foot, barely anticipating a shootout, the report added.Tewari, however, has denied any wrongdoing. He claimed that he had gone to Dubeys house in a bid to persuade him to settle an issue with Rahul Tiwari who had lodged an FIR against him just hours before.Mishra then reached Bikru with a team drawn from three police stations in the vicinity to arrest Dubey. But they were caught by surprise instead.\\xa0Dubeys henchmen put up roadblocks to stop policemen from reaching their hideout. As they got off from their vehicles at one hurdle, there were caught by a hail of gunfire.Mishra (54) was among those killed.\\xa0The other slain policemen were SO Shivrajpur police station Mahesh Kumar Yadav (42), Sub-Inspector Anoop Kumar Singh (32), Sub-Inspector Nebu Lal (48), constables Jitendra Pal (26), Sultan Singh (34), Bablu Kumar (23) and Rahul Kumar (24).Later, the police sealed the entire area and began a combing operation, which led to another encounter with Dubeys men in Nivada village in which two people were killed.Tewari told reporters in a video widely circulated on Saturday that the team went to Dubeys house only to arrest him and did not anticipate the ambush.Do you think that this could have happened. It is the jurisdiction of my police station area, and I will be the person to lag behind others? Some people are floating this theory only to benefit Dubey, he said.An official said that over three dozens people have been detained in the case for questioning.

Even the World Health Organisation\\xa0has pegged them\\xa0as the leading candidate for a viable vaccine.In a recent online call with the Ministers of Parliament of the House of Commons Science and Technology Committee,\\xa0Dr Sarah Gilbert, the\\xa0lead researcher for Oxfords COVID-19 vaccine and Professor of Vaccinology at the Jenner Institute & Nuffield Department of Clinical Medicine,\\xa0spoke\\xa0about the ongoing trial.The coronavirus is a family of viruses and SARS-CoV-2,\\xa0like SARS and MERS, is part of this one big family, identified in the mid-1960s.\\xa0Coronaviruses are known to\\xa0have symptoms like fever, sore throat, headaches, cough, runny nose, etc and are also very common. People who have been infected\\xa0are thought to\\xa0be susceptible to\\xa0getting infected again. This is a major cause\\xa0for concern with a potential COVID-19 vaccine.In order to dispel concerns about re-infections, Gilbert said that the Oxford vaccine should be able to provide ‘a good duration of immunity and she is optimistic about it. She also said a vaccine might provide better results than natural immunity acquired when individuals recover from the virus.Vaccines have a different way of engaging with the immune system, and we follow people in our studies using the same type of technology to make the vaccines for several years, and we still see strong immune responses, said Gilbert.Its something we have to test and follow over time – we cant know until we actually have the data – but were optimistic based on earlier studies that we will see a good duration of immunity, for several years at least, and probably better than naturally-acquired immunity.A vaccine candidate against COVID-19 (the SARS-CoV-2 virus), provided by Imperial College London. About a dozen vaccine candidates are in early stages of testing in thousands of people. Image: Imperial College London via APThe vaccine, which has been given the name AZD1222, is\\xa0licensed to British biopharmaceutical company AstraZeneca, which\\xa0will be manufacturing it if trials succeed.\\xa0The vaccine is currently in\\xa0Phase III human trials,\\xa0in which\\xa0the vaccine is being administered to around 8,000\\xa0participants. The\\xa0trial will assess how the vaccine works in a large number of people over the age of 18,\\xa0and whether\\xa0the vaccine works to prevent people from becoming infected with COVID-19.Gilbert said, Were very happy that were seeing the right sort of immune response that will give protection, and not the wrong sort.Oxford University\\xa0is\\xa0also\\xa0slated to conduct\\xa0human trials in Brazil with 5,000 individuals, in the US with 30,000\\xa0participants and another 2,000 in South Africa.When asked how long will it be till a vaccine is available, Gilbert said she is confident human trials will be completed by the year-end, by which time AstraZeneca plans to manufacture millions of doses in anticipation of approval.However, Kate Bingham, chair of the UK Government Vaccine Taskforce, said that, excluding the Oxford vaccine program that is on track to be completed by August this year, she hopes for a breakthrough in other COVID-19 trials by early 2021.We dont know coronavirus well. Think of examples like HIV and malaria. We know those diseases well, yet we dont have vaccines against them, she told the committee. So we may never get a vaccine, or we may only get a vaccine that modifies the severity of the disease, or lessens its effects.Oxford University Regius Professor of Medicine\\xa0Sir John Bell\\xa0also echoed similar thoughts as Bingham when he said, This whole epidemic has relied too heavily on assumptions that have turned out not to be true. So my strong advice is to be prepared for the worst.Bharat Biotech has passed mandated protocols, animal testing and is now in clinical development of Covid vaccine, Dr Krishna Ella tells FirstpostHyderabad-based Bharat Biotech, one of seven Indian companies involved in the indigenous production of a vaccine for the novel coronavirus, received the green signal from the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) to begin human trials of Covaxin last week.The results offer a strong note of caution against the idea of immunity certificates for people who have recovered from COVID-19.While the ICMR has said it is important to expedite the clinical trials for a promising indigenous vaccine in the public interest and that all other vaccine candidates across the globe have been similarly fast-tracked, scientists in one voice have cautioned against being over-optimisticOn the recommendation of MHA, MEITY has issued orders under Sec. 69 A of the I.T.

FP TrendingJul 04, 2020 13:07:31 ISTThe year 2020 has already witnessed two penumbral lunar eclipses so far. The third penumbral eclipse or Chandra Grahan of the year is all set to take place on 5 July.The lunar eclipse will be visible across much of North and South America and Africa. During the maximum phase, the moon may turn slightly darker than usual, according to\\xa0timeanddate.com.The penumbral lunar eclipse will start at around 8.37 am IST on July 5 and will go on till 11.22 am IST. The maximum eclipse will be at 9:59 am IST. It will last for approximately 2 hours and 45 minutes.According to NASA, a lunar eclipse occurs when the earth moves between the sun and the moon. When this happens, the earth blocks the sunlight that normally is reflected by the moon. Instead of the light reaching the moons surface, the earths shadow falls on it.A penumbral eclipse creates only a dark shading on the moons face. If the moon passes through the dark central shadow of the earth, which is also called the umbra, a partial or total lunar eclipse occurs. However, if the celestial body passes through the penumbra or the outer part of the shadow, a penumbral eclipse occurs.Traditionally Julys full moon is called a Buck moon because a bucks antlers are in full growth mode this period.\\xa0 According to Forbes, the Buck moon eclipse will see about 35 percent of the full Moon pass into the Earths outer shadow and lose some of its brightness.tags5 July5 July Chandra Grahan5 July Lunar Eclipse5 July Lunar Eclipse In IndiaChandra GrahanJuly 2020 Chandra GrahanJuly 2020 Lunar EclipseJuly Chandra GrahanJuly Lunar EclipseJuly Lunar Eclipse DateJuly Lunar Eclipse TimeJuly Penumbral Lunar EclipseLunar EclipseLunar Eclipse 2020Lunar Eclipse TimePenumbral Lunar EclipseFind latest and upcoming tech gadgets online on Tech2 Gadgets.

The vaccine candidate was developed in collaboration with the\\xa0Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and the National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune.The ICMR has selected 12 institutes across the country to carry out clinical trials of Covaxin and on Friday, urged the chosen clinical trial sites to expedite approvals and complete recruiting for the trails by 7 July, as per an internal letter from ICMR to the institutions.The letter also reportedly\\xa0said that Covaxin should be launched for public use by 15 August, however, Bharat Biotech spokespersons refused to comment on the statement.The letter by ICMR director general Balram Bhargava read, It is envisaged to launch the vaccine for public health use latest by 15th August 2020 after completion of all clinical trials. BBIL (Bharat Biotech International Limited) is working expeditiously to meet the target, however, final outcome will depend on the cooperation of all clinical trial sites involved in this project.Covaxin has been expedited through national regulatory protocols, and subjected to comprehensive pre-clinical studies according to the company, which reports that the results are promising and show extensive safety and effective immune responses.In the past, Bharat Biotech has manufactured the H1N1 vaccine during the swine flu outbreak and has over 140 global patents and 16 vaccines in its portfolio. The most significant of their developments is arguably the rotavirus vaccine Rotavac, a next-gen vaccine against viral gastroenteritis that got pre-approval from the WHO after an Oxford laboratory found it safe and efficacious.Firstpost spoke to Dr Ella about the development of Covaxin, the estimated cost, and the future course of action regarding the vaccine. Edited excerpts follow:What was the process of development of the vaccine, what were the various stages before Bharat Biotech approached CDSCO for approval for human trials?The virus strain was first isolated by the National Institute of Virology, Pune after it was collected by ICMR. This isolated strain was then used to develop a vaccine candidate at Bharat Biotech.Upon receipt of the virus strain from the NIV Pune, Bharat Biotech was able to quickly layout the GMP (good manufacturing practices) protocols for the manufacture of the vaccine candidate. Bharat Biotech took to develop the first set of GMP batches within 40 days and upon completion, the pre-clinical trials commenced.COVAXIN™ was evaluated in animals on Schedule Y Guidelines (Schedule Y defines the clinical trials as the requirements and guidelines for import and manufacture of new drugs for sale or for clinical trials. It describes the details of the application process for conducting clinical trials; responsibilities of the sponsor, investigators and the guidelines of Indias Independent Ethics Committee) and the World Health Organisation.COVAXIN™ was reported to be safe and immunogenic in all animals. We have now moved forward towards the clinical development of this vaccine.What are you expecting the vaccine to do based on your clinical trials so far? What are some of the key findings of the vaccine from your trials?Upon receipt of the virus strain from the NIV Pune, Bharat Biotech was able to quickly layout the GMP protocols for the manufacture of the vaccine candidate. Bharat Biotech took to develop the first set of GMP batches within 40 days and upon completion, the pre-clinical trials commenced. COVAXIN™ was evaluated in animals on Schedule Y Guidelines from India and WHO Guidelines. COVAXIN™ was reported to be safe and immunogenic in all animals. We have now moved forward towards the clinical development of this vaccine.Is it likely to be more effective in some people than others? How long is the vaccine likely to be effective?Conventionally, inactivated vaccines have been around for decades. Numerous vaccines such as seasonal influenza, polio, pertussis, rabies, and Japanese Encephalitis use the same technology to develop inactivated vaccines. Once the vaccine is injected into a human, it has no potential to infect or replicate, since it is a killed virus. It just serves the immune system as a dead virus and mounts an antibody response towards the virus.Which authority might be likely to decide the cost of the vaccine? If its Bharat Biotech, what is the estimated cost?As a socially inclined organisation and a company that is focussed on public health, we endeavour to deliver world-class vaccines at affordable prices. We have done this earlier and we hope to achieve the same even for COVAXIN™. We must say that it is too early to make any statement regarding the price.Coronavirus Updates:Students will be promoted to the next class without any examination but a decision on determination of marks will be taken in the next few days, said Technical Education Minister Subhash GargPIB uploads article claiming none of six Indian companies working on COVID-19 vaccine will have it ready before 2021, later removes mention of yearThe statement deleted from the article on PIB contradicted the Indian Council of Medical Researchs plan to launch a vaccine by 15 August this year.The ICMR envisages launching the vaccine for public health use by 15 August after completion of all clinical trials, as per a letter to institutions conducting trials.While the ICMR has said it is important to expedite the clinical trials for a promising indigenous vaccine in the public interest and that all other vaccine candidates across the globe have been similarly fast-tracked, scientists in one voice have cautioned against being over-optimisticOn the recommendation of MHA, MEITY has issued orders under Sec. 69 A of the I.T. Act, 2000, for blocking 40 websites of SFJ, a home ministry spokesperson said.More than 1,000 doctors, nurses and paramedics of the ITBP and other Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs), and another 1,000 paramedics, assistants and security staff have been deployed at the facility in Delhi for its smooth operation.The administration has announced a compensation of Rs 4 lakh each for the families of the dead workers. The injured will be given Rs 50,000 each.ICMR said that the letter by its director general Balram Bhargava to investigators of the clinical trial sites was meant to cut unnecessary red tape, without bypassing any necessary processThe Phase I and Phase II clinical trials of the vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, approved after pre-clinical studies demonstrated safety and immune response, would start across the country next month.Dr Anant Bhan, a researcher in global health, bioethics and health policy and former president of International Association of Bioethics, spoke to Firstpost about the extreme urgency shown by ICMR in developing Indias COVID-19 vaccine, COVAXIN, by 15 AugustA virologist said that a vaccine normally takes at least 12-18 months to pass all necessary clinical trial phases while the company developing it has just over a month to wrap up everythingWhile the ICMR has said it is important to expedite the clinical trials for a promising indigenous vaccine in the public interest and that all other vaccine candidates across the globe have been similarly fast-tracked, scientists in one voice have cautioned against being over-optimistic', '2020-07-03 12:28:29', 0.0, 9.899999618530273, '/Health/Medical Facilities & Services/Medical Procedures', 0.910000026, '/Law & Government/Public Safety', 0.899999976, '2020-07-05 20:36:31.244658', '2020-07-05 20:36:31.244660', 'Firstpost2020-07-03 12:28:29COVID-19 vaccine | Passed mandated protocols, animal testing and now in clinical development stage: Bharat Biotech#39;s Dr Krishna Ella', 'https://www.firstpost.com/health/bharat-biotech-has-passed-mandated-protocols-animal-testing-and-is-now-in-clinical-development-of-covid-19-vaccine-dr-krishna-ella-tells-firstpost-8555261.html')\n",

The statement, which contradicts the Indian Council of Medical Researchs plan to launch a vaccine by 15 August this year, was a part of an article written by TV Venkateswaran, a scientist at Vigyan Prasar, an autonomous organisation under the Union governments department of science and technology.Speaking to Firstpost, Venkateswaran said that while the statement was a part of the original article, the line was removed as the year was not the point of the article.Venkateswaran told Firstpost, The main purpose of the article was to explain in simple language how the two vaccines that are being developed in India (COVAXIN and ZyCov-D) work. When I said that the vaccines will not be available before 2021, it was a statement that was based on certain facts. Even if we have a drug today, we would need about 12 crore doses of it in order for it to reach even 10 percent of the population. One cannot produce 12 crore doses of a drug merely by waving a magic wand. In that sense, the statement in the article was a very ordinary one. However, the PIB most likely thought that such a firm statement might unnecessarily confuse the public, and so they edited it out.However, in the original article, the statement in question was not made in the context of the challenges in producing a certain number of doses of the vaccine. The paragraph before the line in question had mentioned that globally, 140 vaccines against COVID-19 are under various stages of development.In the next paragraph, the author spoke about the scenario in India. He wrote, Parallelly, Indian institutions have also engaged in R&D for the development of vaccines in India. With the primary scientific inputs coming from institutions like Pune based ICMR Institution, National Institute of Virology and Hyderabad based CSIR institution Center for Cellular and Molecular Biology, six Indian companies are working on a vaccine for COVID-19. Along with the two Indian vaccines, COVAXIN and ZyCov-D, the world over, 11 out of 140 vaccine candidates have entered the human trials. None of these vaccines is unlikely to be ready for mass use before 2021. (sic)On 4 July, Venkateswaran also wrote an article on the news website The Federal, in which he spoke in detail about the process of conducting the clinical trial of COVAXIN. He wrote, The public information available in the Clinical Trial Registry of India (CTRI) indicates that the follow ups of the trial will be carried on Day 14, Day 28, Day 104 and Day 194, that is about six months. The whole effort may take a year and three months according to the submission made by Bharat Biotech.Elaborating on the\\xa0above statement, Venkateswaran told Firstpost, If Bharat Biotech (which is developing the vaccine) says that the process will take a year and three months, who am I to counter or question it? I have no role in that.At the heart on the ongoing controversy is a letter written by the ICMR to Bharat Biotech on 2 July, in which it stated that it is envisaged to launch the vaccine for public health use latest by 15 August. Several experts have questioned whether a vaccine launched at such a short deadline would compromise standards of safety and efficacy.As of now, Bharat Biotech have not commented on whether it is feasible to launch the vaccine on 15 August, instead of the original deadline of one year and three months. However, speaking to Firstpost, Dr Chandrasekhar Gillurkar, one of the investigators in the clinical trial, said, It will be difficult to finish the trials by 15 August. However, the results of Phase 1 of the trial, and a general inclination of the results of Phase 2 can become known by that date. The government can get an initial idea about the safety and immunogenicity (ability of a foreign substance to provoke an immune response in the human body) of the vaccine by that deadline. Even after 15 August, the various processes involved in the trial will go on.When asked whether it would be correct to claim that the vaccine would be ready for public health use by 15 August, Gillurkar said, No, it is difficult to say that. However, once we submit our report, the government will take a decision on what action to take on it.

The\\xa0immune system\\xa0produces antibodies as part of a larger process to defend itself from an infection.That said, antibody tests may not be able to show whether the virus is currently infecting the body.\\xa0Unlike a nasal or throat swab test, which looks for genetic signatures of the virus\\xa0in the body,\\xa0an antibody test looks for\\xa0traces of the bodys\\xa0response to the virus.Antibodies are abundant in the blood,\\xa0so a sample of blood is\\xa0collected\\xa0by either a finger prick or\\xa0a blood sample drawn with a needle. Two specific\\xa0antibody types are sought out in an antibody test:At\\xa0the community\\xa0and national levels,\\xa0widespread antibody testing\\xa0gives\\xa0researchers and authorities estimates of the rate of\\xa0infection (how quickly the virus is spreading in a population), and how fatal COVID-19 is. This data\\xa0informs important decisions around\\xa0testing,\\xa0prevention, and treatment of\\xa0COVID-19.Along with other information collected from patients in hospitals, antibody testing can also offer information on\\xa0what factors affect the severity of infection, and why some people are more severely impacted than others.Vaccines are developed under the principle that a shot\\xa0imitates a mild case of the infection itself, and once injected, it helps the\\xa0immune system mount a stronger attack against a pathogen when it does attack.\\xa0This offers some protection from a full-scale attack of COVID-19.\\xa0Antibodies are made more quickly and copiously as part of this vaccine-enabled response.Margin of error:\\xa0Antibody tests are important for establishing who has had the virus, especially because\\xa0a percentage of\\xa0people infected seem to show no symptoms. An antibody test can give results in under an hour.\\xa0For instance, the ICMR-approved antibody testing kits show results within 30 minutes.\\xa0The test\\xa0can be used 7 to 10 days after someone\\xa0is infected, but do have a larger percentage of error than swab tests.Antibody tests\\xa0that look for IgM antibodies are usually rapid finger prick tests that can deliver results in\\xa0under 20 minutes. But\\xa0IgG tests require a blood sample to be sent to a lab – a process that could take\\xa0a week to deliver\\xa0results. IgG tests are\\xa0more reliable than IgM rapid tests, but dont reveal as much information about someones COVID-19 infection.False negatives and false positive:\\xa0The many diagnostic kits in circulation currently are a necessity – but they are also products of fast-track approval and developing research into COVID-19, where\\xa0the priority\\xa0is\\xa0public health demand and speed.Considering the developing nature of ongoing COVID-19 research,\\xa0there is no assurance of quality, or guarantee that a test result is 100 percent accurate.\\xa0Some kits will perform better than others.There\\xa0may be\\xa0cases where exposure to COVID-19 isnt followed by the production of antibodies\\xa0in an individual, showing up as a false negative. Tests that\\xa0arent of high-quality may also\\xa0show a false positive\\xa0if an individual\\xa0has another, very similar virus in\\xa0the body.Currently, ICMR is the authority recommending the most suitable kit for widespread antibody testing after making these due considerations.\\xa0A\\xa0report in the\\xa0Hindu\\xa0highlights\\xa0multiple instances of quality assurance of\\xa0testing kits being severely lacking.Doctors can examine the blood of COVID-19 patients to identify those at greatest risk of severe illness and to pinpoint those most likely to need a ventilator. Image credit: U.S. Marine Corps/Pfc. Stephen CampbellOverwhelming inaccuracies in testing asymptomatics:\\xa0There have been\\xa0a few dozen studies that measure\\xa0the accuracy of antibody tests compared with a reference standard\\xa0to detect an ongoing or past COVID-19 infection. In a review of these studies, authors found that\\xa0antibody tests one week after the first symptoms appeared only detected 30 percent of\\xa0positive COVID-19 cases. The accuracy increased in\\xa0the second\\xa0week, with 70 percent of cases detected.\\xa0It was highest in\\xa0the third week, with\\xa0over\\xa090 percent of cases detected.We know that it\\xa0takes anywhere between 1-3 weeks to develop antibodies after symptoms occur, which\\xa0makes the test as good as a coinflip in\\xa0people who\\xa0dont show symptoms.False sense of security:\\xa0While this isnt a challenge of antibody tests exclusively, it is one that needs to be considered. On getting a positive\\xa0COVID-19 antibody test,\\xa0a person may very well think that having COVID-19 antibodies\\xa0gives them\\xa0immune to the virus and wont catch it again. There is currently no evidence to suggest that people who have recovered from COVID-19 are immune to catching it again.Even\\xa0if studies show\\xa0antibodies\\xa0are found to\\xa0offer immunity,\\xa0it is\\xa0difficult to establish\\xa0how much antibody is needed to\\xa0offer this protection,\\xa0or how long the protection might last. Scientists world over are\\xa0carrying out research\\xa0studies to answer these questions.There\\xa0are also rapid tests\\xa0in use in some countries to diagnose active COVID-19 cases,\\xa0since the tests would be much quicker and less invasive than the current swabs. The two kinds of rapid tests being used in India\\xa0currently are the antigen test and RT-PCR test.Antigen\\xa0tests\\xa0seek out\\xa0specific proteins only found in the virus, which the\\xa0bodys immune response recognises as foreign.\\xa0Most\\xa0COVID-19 antigen tests target the\\xa0spike protein that studs the surface of the coronavirus.The structure and cross-sectional view of Human Coronavirus. It shows depicting the shape of coronavirus as well as the cross-sectional view. Image credit: WikipediaA\\xa0swab from the nose is collected for this test, where theres a high likelihood of virus particles being present. The swab is then dipped in a solution that\\xa0inactivates\\xa0the virus, and\\xa0then\\xa0transferred\\xa0onto a test strip.\\xa0The test strip\\xa0houses antibodies that bind to coronavirus proteins and hold them in place as the fluid spreads.One of the major advantages of using antigen\\xa0is that it reduces the burden of relying on just RT-PCR tests to identify COVID-19 patients.Antigen testing is useful because even if its less sensitive, it is rapid and the results that are positive will be positive, Dr Gagandeep Kang, executive director of the Transnational Health Service and Technology Institute, told thePrint\\xa0in an interview. So, patients who test positive can get into isolation faster.Since antigen testing doesnt involve any processes of amplifying the virus or its genetic material,\\xa0a swab sample may have too little\\xa0antigen to be detected. This\\xa0could produce\\xa0a\\xa0false negative result. As a precaution, a negative test should be followed up by\\xa0the more accurate RT-PCR test,\\xa0to confirm\\xa0a true negative for COVID-19.A PCR test is a widely-used,\\xa0highly\\xa0sensitive test that\\xa0seeks out\\xa0traces of genetic material\\xa0from a specific\\xa0pathogen, if\\xa0the pathogen\\xa0is present\\xa0in the body.\\xa0The technique\\xa0is a powerful diagnostic tool that can\\xa0identify both DNA or RNA from specific microorganisms, irrespective of whether\\xa0they are bacteria or viruses.A PCR\\xa0can capture a specific gene from\\xa0genetic material (DNA or RNA)\\xa0in\\xa0a swab sample, and multiply it through a series of chemical processes so it can be detected using fluorescent dyes.While some viruses have only DNA, others like SARS-CoV-2, only contain RNA. Viruses\\xa0infect a healthy cell and hack into the natural\\xa0machinery that cells use to process our own RNA,\\xa0so the virus particle\\xa0can multiply and survive.\\xa0Once inside\\xa0a cell, the virus uses its RNA\\xa0to take control of the cells machinery and ‘reprogramme\\xa0the cell into a virus-making factory.To detect an RNA virus\\xa0like SARS-CoV-2, scientists use\\xa0an enzyme (reverse transcriptase)\\xa0to convert the viruss RNA into DNA, in a simple and widely-used one-step process\\xa0called ‘reverse transcription. This\\xa0allows a single\\xa0molecule of\\xa0DNA\\xa0to be\\xa0amplified\\xa0exponentially (millions of times), which is the\\xa0main goal of the\\xa0PCR process, so even virus particles in single digits can be detected in the final result.An RT-PCR test is considered\\xa0very reliable because it\\xa0can detect\\xa0even\\xa0a single virus particle in swabs taken from inside the mouth or nose, where the virus particles are most prevalent.Swift, sensitive and specific:\\xa0There are real-time variations of the RT–PCR technique\\xa0that are quick,\\xa0super sensitive, and specific.\\xa0They can deliver a reliable diagnosis in three\\xa0hours. That said, the\\xa0process on average takes around eight hours\\xa0to produce\\xa0a conclusive result.More accurate, less prone to contamination:\\xa0Compared to other methods to isolate and detect viruses, RT–PCR is\\xa0much faster and less likely to be\\xa0contaminated or cause errors during the testing process.\\xa0This is\\xa0because the\\xa0test – start to finish – is\\xa0carried out\\xa0in\\xa0an enclosed tube, inside a specialised, automated machine.Severity of infection can be estimated:\\xa0A standard real-time RT–PCR set-up usually goes through 35 cycles, which means that, by the end of the process, around 35 billion new copies of the sections of viral DNA are created from each strand of the virus present in the sample.Only\\xa0detects\\xa0ongoing infection:\\xa0The main limitation of RT-PCR testing is that it\\xa0cannot be used to detect a past infection with SARS-CoV-2, which is important for understanding the development and spread of the virus, as viruses are only present in the body for a specific window of time.Other methods are necessary to detect, track and study past infections, particularly those which may have developed and spread without symptoms. Once you have recovered, the virus is eliminated and these tests can no longer tell if youve been infected. This creates significant uncertainty, especially if someone has self-isolated due to mild and unclear symptoms.Requires specialised equipment, training:\\xa0Unlike antibody testing, which requires a kit and medical/paramedical personnel trained in using the kit, RT-PCR testing needs specific instruments in a laboratory,\\xa0which\\xa0makes it\\xa0more time-consuming. Even if the test itself takes\\xa0just a few hours, the process of collecting and labeling samples, transporting them to a lab, and processing the samples in bulk\\xa0ensure that it is\\xa0days before the results from a single sample are known.Portable, rapid RT-PCR machines are\\xa0at the cutting edge of diagnostic technology, and often require specialised training\\xa0to ensure the machine isnt misused, which requires some level of expertise and training. Tests are only\\xa0now\\xa0being developed and made\\xa0available\\xa0for\\xa0these advanced instruments.Quality control is\\xa0not\\xa0a guarantee:\\xa0In a pandemic, the use of even very accurate diagnostic tools is more error-prone than daily diagnostic tests. RT-PCR, while a\\xa0revolutionary tool in diagnosis,\\xa0can also be easily misused or misinterpreted. It\\xa0depends on a reliable existing\\xa0DNA sample of the virus,\\xa0as a reference, to find the pathogen in a test. It\\xa0is also sensitive enough to\\xa0pick up on contamination as a false positive.Back when the outbreak first began to spread in India, the National Institute of Virology in Pune was the only laboratory testing for COVID-19. Today, there are 1,000.\\xa0The validity and accuracy of a test depend entirely on the laboratorys quality.\\xa0The Hindu\\xa0reports\\xa0multiple instances of private and public testing labs (including quality assurance labs) returning false positives at an alarming rate.\\xa0Experts have\\xa0called for\\xa0internal quality control and external quality assessment as an urgent requirement\\xa0if PCR testing is to be considered reliable.Most modern PCR tests\\xa0can\\xa0detect\\xa0a wide range of pathogens\\xa0in real-time, with results visible\\xa0as the chain reaction is underway. TrueNat\\xa0is a chip-based, portable RT-PCR machine, originally developed as a portable diagnostic tool for tuberculosis by\\xa0Goa-based startup\\xa0 Molbio Diagnostics.The device is\\xa0on its way\\xa0to becoming one of the\\xa0main diagnostic tools for COVID-19 as India looks to expand its testing capacity. It\\xa0is the fastest available PCR-based technique recommended by ICMR till date.The latest versions of the TrueNat machine\\xa0can detect\\xa0an\\xa0enzyme (called RdRp) found in the RNA of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. The ICMR has ruled that these tests can be treated as a confirmation for the presence of the coronavirus.TrueNat can\\xa0return results faster time than the standard RT-PCR tests, according to Sriram Natarajan, CEO of Molbio Diagnostics.\\xa0But it is\\xa0not as accurate.\\xa0Cases found positive\\xa0in a TrueNat device\\xa0need\\xa0to be reconfirmed\\xa0with traditional RT-PCR testing, as per an ICMR advisory.In a letter shared by\\xa0ANI dated 4 July, ICMR\\xa0has\\xa0advised\\xa0private laboratories in states and Union Territories that intend to use TrueNat for COVID-19 testing to apply for NABL accreditation immediately, to\\xa0ensure reliable results.Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has written to all states/UTs saying that all private laboratories in their state who intend to initiate TrueNat/CBNAAT based testing for #COVID19 should be encouraged to immediately apply for NABL accreditation to ensure quality testing. pic.twitter.com/zm3Xlva3AvMost countries have turned to PCR-based testing because they are reliable and the fastest to develop. Since antibody testing is often\\xa0a\\xa0quicker, inexpensive, and easily-scalable option,\\xa0the number of reported cases climbs steeply as antibody testing is expanded, and gaps in testing\\xa0are addressed.Big differences in testing strategies from country-to-country make the\\xa0net numbers between countries incomparable in any\\xa0real sense. But nationally, standardised procedures and equipment for widespread testing can ensure that consistent data is released.Testing capacity\\xa0continues to be\\xa0a challenge for India considering the scale of the outbreak, the\\xa0rapidly developing nature of the outbreak in some states, the slow evolution of research and reliable test kits, and quality control of testing procedures.Coronavirus Updates: RJD MLA Shahnawaz Alam has tested positive for COVID-19, the fourth legislator in Bihar to have contracted the disease.Coronavirus Updates:Students will be promoted to the next class without any examination but a decision on determination of marks will be taken in the next few days, said Technical Education Minister Subhash GargIn an address during the virtual meeting of the American Association of Physicians of Indian Origin (AAPI) on Saturday, Narendra Modi said that the COVID-19 had been used as an opportunity to work towards making the country self-reliant.While the ICMR has said it is important to expedite the clinical trials for a promising indigenous vaccine in the public interest and that all other vaccine candidates across the globe have been similarly fast-tracked, scientists in one voice have cautioned against being over-optimisticOn the recommendation of MHA, MEITY has issued orders under Sec. 69 A of the I.T.

He used to extort money from people, he added.Police officials claimed that a large team had to be deployed as angry villagers could have attacked Dubeys family. But the situation did not go out of control due to the police presence, Agarwal said.Soon after Senior Superintendent of Police Dinesh Prabhu reached the village, police officials hired a driver who was asked to demolish Dubeys mansion by using an earth mover.\\xa0TV channels also showed visuals of luxury cars in the complex being crushed by the giant machines.\\xa0A 12-ft high boundary wall with barbed wires was also razed.Before the demolition, Dubeys father and a domestic help were evicted from the premises. I have been ailing, so I dont know what has happened. I cant see or hear properly, he said to queries from reporters.According to the villagers, the new house was built about seven year ago and had CCTV cameras at various conspicuous places inside the premises as well as outside the four entry gates and one main gate.Around 80 metres from the main gate, there was a four-room luxurious accommodation where Dubey used to live, which was also demolished.Local police told PTI that Dubey, who had 60 cases against him, maintained a private militia and recruited mostly local youths. He also provided them with weapons, the news\\xa0agency said.A few villagers, when approached, were reluctant to speak. A young girl when asked why many houses in the villages were locked said that most of the people living in the vicinity of her house work in Kanpur, and come to the village on Sundays.Swinging into action after the brutal deaths of the policemen, 25 police teams fanned out across Uttar Pradesh and other states to hunt down Dubey and his associates, officials said.\\xa0 The attackers had fled, snatching weapons from the dead and the wounded policemen.Police officials also said a surveillance team was scanning over 500 mobile phones and frantic efforts were on to retrieve information from the devices.An official indicated that about 30 people were detained for questioning. Another said there was a possibility that Dubey may have fled to Nepal or taken shelter in a neighbouring state.A cash reward of Rs 50,000 has been announced for providing information about Dubey and the identity of the information provider will be kept secret,\\xa0News18\\xa0reported.In view of the allegations levelled against SO, he has been suspended, and all the allegations are being thoroughly looked into. If his involvement or that of any other personnel of the police is found in this incident, then they will be sacked from the department, and also sent to jail, IG Mohit Agarwal told reporters.Hindustan Times,\\xa0quoting sources in the local police department, said the initial investigation hinted that Dubey was well aware about the police raid at his house and prepared to deal with it.Dubey was apparently tipped off by his men in the police department about the force from three police stations Bilhaur, Bithoor and Chaubeypur moving towards his village,\\xa0the\\xa0Hindustan Times\\xa0report said.Dubey had already blocked the main entrance of the village with heavy machines, forcing the police personnel to walk to Dubeys house on foot, barely anticipating a shootout, the report added.Tewari, however, has denied any wrongdoing. He claimed that he had gone to Dubeys house in a bid to persuade him to settle an issue with Rahul Tiwari who had lodged an FIR against him just hours before.Mishra then reached Bikru with a team drawn from three police stations in the vicinity to arrest Dubey. But they were caught by surprise instead.\\xa0Dubeys henchmen put up roadblocks to stop policemen from reaching their hideout. As they got off from their vehicles at one hurdle, there were caught by a hail of gunfire.Mishra (54) was among those killed.\\xa0The other slain policemen were SO Shivrajpur police station Mahesh Kumar Yadav (42), Sub-Inspector Anoop Kumar Singh (32), Sub-Inspector Nebu Lal (48), constables Jitendra Pal (26), Sultan Singh (34), Bablu Kumar (23) and Rahul Kumar (24).Later, the police sealed the entire area and began a combing operation, which led to another encounter with Dubeys men in Nivada village in which two people were killed.Tewari told reporters in a video widely circulated on Saturday that the team went to Dubeys house only to arrest him and did not anticipate the ambush.Do you think that this could have happened. It is the jurisdiction of my police station area, and I will be the person to lag behind others? Some people are floating this theory only to benefit Dubey, he said.An official said that over three dozens people have been detained in the case for questioning.

Users either have to face the music or delete the tweet completely hoping nobody noticed.An edit tweet option would allow users to correct themselves if they posted something inaccurate or later realised any error in the tweet, according to a CNBC report.Back in 2015, Kim Kardashian tweeted that she emailed Twitter to see of an edit feature can be added, to which Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey had replied, that it was a great idea.I just emailed Twitter to see if they can add an edit feature so that when u misspell something u dont have to delete & repost Lets see...But since then, things appear to have changed. CEO Jack Dorsey had said at the\\xa0start of the year that the company will probably never do it,\\xa0according to a report in the Independent.When asked by a Twitter user if the long-requested edit button would be introduced in 2020, Dorsey had replied, The answer is no, the report added.The article cited an interaction Dorsey had with Wired where he had said that they had started as an SMS service and that they wanted to preserve the vibe, that feeling, in the early days.Find latest and upcoming tech gadgets online on Tech2 Gadgets.

Even the World Health Organisation\\xa0has pegged them\\xa0as the leading candidate for a viable vaccine.In a recent online call with the Ministers of Parliament of the House of Commons Science and Technology Committee,\\xa0Dr Sarah Gilbert, the\\xa0lead researcher for Oxfords COVID-19 vaccine and Professor of Vaccinology at the Jenner Institute & Nuffield Department of Clinical Medicine,\\xa0spoke\\xa0about the ongoing trial.The coronavirus is a family of viruses and SARS-CoV-2,\\xa0like SARS and MERS, is part of this one big family, identified in the mid-1960s.\\xa0Coronaviruses are known to\\xa0have symptoms like fever, sore throat, headaches, cough, runny nose, etc and are also very common. People who have been infected\\xa0are thought to\\xa0be susceptible to\\xa0getting infected again. This is a major cause\\xa0for concern with a potential COVID-19 vaccine.In order to dispel concerns about re-infections, Gilbert said that the Oxford vaccine should be able to provide ‘a good duration of immunity and she is optimistic about it. She also said a vaccine might provide better results than natural immunity acquired when individuals recover from the virus.Vaccines have a different way of engaging with the immune system, and we follow people in our studies using the same type of technology to make the vaccines for several years, and we still see strong immune responses, said Gilbert.Its something we have to test and follow over time – we cant know until we actually have the data – but were optimistic based on earlier studies that we will see a good duration of immunity, for several years at least, and probably better than naturally-acquired immunity.A vaccine candidate against COVID-19 (the SARS-CoV-2 virus), provided by Imperial College London. About a dozen vaccine candidates are in early stages of testing in thousands of people. Image: Imperial College London via APThe vaccine, which has been given the name AZD1222, is\\xa0licensed to British biopharmaceutical company AstraZeneca, which\\xa0will be manufacturing it if trials succeed.\\xa0The vaccine is currently in\\xa0Phase III human trials,\\xa0in which\\xa0the vaccine is being administered to around 8,000\\xa0participants. The\\xa0trial will assess how the vaccine works in a large number of people over the age of 18,\\xa0and whether\\xa0the vaccine works to prevent people from becoming infected with COVID-19.Gilbert said, Were very happy that were seeing the right sort of immune response that will give protection, and not the wrong sort.Oxford University\\xa0is\\xa0also\\xa0slated to conduct\\xa0human trials in Brazil with 5,000 individuals, in the US with 30,000\\xa0participants and another 2,000 in South Africa.When asked how long will it be till a vaccine is available, Gilbert said she is confident human trials will be completed by the year-end, by which time AstraZeneca plans to manufacture millions of doses in anticipation of approval.However, Kate Bingham, chair of the UK Government Vaccine Taskforce, said that, excluding the Oxford vaccine program that is on track to be completed by August this year, she hopes for a breakthrough in other COVID-19 trials by early 2021.We dont know coronavirus well. Think of examples like HIV and malaria. We know those diseases well, yet we dont have vaccines against them, she told the committee. So we may never get a vaccine, or we may only get a vaccine that modifies the severity of the disease, or lessens its effects.Oxford University Regius Professor of Medicine\\xa0Sir John Bell\\xa0also echoed similar thoughts as Bingham when he said, This whole epidemic has relied too heavily on assumptions that have turned out not to be true. So my strong advice is to be prepared for the worst.Bharat Biotech has passed mandated protocols, animal testing and is now in clinical development of Covid vaccine, Dr Krishna Ella tells FirstpostHyderabad-based Bharat Biotech, one of seven Indian companies involved in the indigenous production of a vaccine for the novel coronavirus, received the green signal from the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) to begin human trials of Covaxin last week.The results offer a strong note of caution against the idea of immunity certificates for people who have recovered from COVID-19.While the ICMR has said it is important to expedite the clinical trials for a promising indigenous vaccine in the public interest and that all other vaccine candidates across the globe have been similarly fast-tracked, scientists in one voice have cautioned against being over-optimisticOn the recommendation of MHA, MEITY has issued orders under Sec. 69 A of the I.T. Act, 2000, for blocking 40 websites of SFJ, a home ministry spokesperson said.More than 1,000 doctors, nurses and paramedics of the ITBP and other Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs), and another 1,000 paramedics, assistants and security staff have been deployed at the facility in Delhi for its smooth operation.The administration has announced a compensation of Rs 4 lakh each for the families of the dead workers. The injured will be given Rs 50,000 each.The vaccine showed a strong immune response in animal studies and will begin human trials this month in over 1,000 subjects in multiple sites.The ICMR envisages launching the vaccine for public health use by 15 August after completion of all clinical trials, as per a letter to institutions conducting trials.Right from selecting the strategy for delivery of COVID-19 vaccine to recruiting a large volunteer staff, every tool must be analysed from the perspective of Indias unique public health system and its capabilitiesPIB uploads article claiming none of six Indian companies working on COVID-19 vaccine will have it ready before 2021, later removes mention of yearThe statement deleted from the article on PIB contradicted the Indian Council of Medical Researchs plan to launch a vaccine by 15 August this year.AMS candidate, named ARCoV, uses mRNA technology, an approach also used by Moderna Inc in the United States and German firm CureVac.', '2020-07-04 08:59:19', 0.0, 10.300000190734863, '/Law & Government/Public Safety', 0.910000026, '/Health/Medical Facilities & Services/Medical Procedures', 0.790000021, '2020-07-05 20:36:16.986173', '2020-07-05 20:36:16.986176', 'Firstpost2020-07-04 08:59:19Oxfords vaccine offers ‘good duration of immunity to COVID-19 compared to no vaccine: lead researcher', 'https://www.firstpost.com/health/oxfords-vaccine-offers-good-duration-of-immunity-to-covid-19-compared-to-no-vaccine-lead-researcher-8556311.html'), (0, 'Firstpost', 'FP Trending', 'Third penumbral lunar eclipse on 5 July 2020: Time, duration and visibility from anywhere in India', 'The eclipse will start at around 8.37 am IST on July 5 and will go on till 11.22 am IST with it reaching its maximum at 9:59 am IST.', 'Best smartphones under 40KOnePlus 7T, iQOO 3 and moreMonday, July 06, 2020Back toSpacial secretsBig, hungry black hole devours one sun per dayHomeGadgetsMobilesLatest Mobile PhonesPopular Mobile PhonesUpcoming Mobile PhonesPopular CompareXiaomi Mobile PhonesSamsung Mobile PhonesVivo Mobile PhonesRealme Mobile PhonesOPPO Mobile PhonesMotorola Mobile PhonesNokia Mobile PhonesOnePlus Mobile PhonesApple Mobile PhonesLG Mobile PhonesHuawei Mobile PhonesAsus Mobile PhonesHonor Mobile PhonesSony Mobile PhonesGoogle Mobile PhonesHTC Mobile PhonesMicromax Mobile PhonesBlackberry Mobile PhonesLava Mobile PhonesLaptopsLatest LaptopsPopular LaptopsUpcoming LaptopsPopular CompareSony LaptopsToshiba LaptopsAcer LaptopsDell LaptopsLenovo LaptopsHP LaptopsAsus LaptopsMicrosoft LaptopsApple LaptopsSamsung LaptopsTabletsLatest TabletsPopular TabletsUpcoming TabletsPopular CompareSamsung TabletsMicrosoft TabletsApple TabletsMicromax TabletsSony TabletsLG TabletsHTC TabletsNokia TabletsKarbonn TabletsNewsReviewsAll ReviewsMobileLaptopAudioScienceAutoGamingPhotosVideosHow ToTechnology NewsScienceThird penumbral lunar eclipse on 5 July 2020: Time, duration and visibility from IndiaThe eclipse will start at around 8.37 am IST on July 5 and will go on till 11.22 am IST with it reaching its maximum at 9:59 am IST. FP TrendingJul 04, 2020 13:07:31 ISTThe year 2020 has already witnessed two penumbral lunar eclipses so far. The third penumbral eclipse or Chandra Grahan of the year is all set to take place on 5 July.The lunar eclipse will be visible across much of North and South America and Africa. During the maximum phase, the moon may turn slightly darker than usual, according to\\xa0timeanddate.com.The penumbral lunar eclipse will start at around 8.37 am IST on July 5 and will go on till 11.22 am IST. The maximum eclipse will be at 9:59 am IST. It will last for approximately 2 hours and 45 minutes.According to NASA, a lunar eclipse occurs when the earth moves between the sun and the moon. When this happens, the earth blocks the sunlight that normally is reflected by the moon. Instead of the light reaching the moons surface, the earths shadow falls on it.A penumbral eclipse creates only a dark shading on the moons face. If the moon passes through the dark central shadow of the earth, which is also called the umbra, a partial or total lunar eclipse occurs. However, if the celestial body passes through the penumbra or the outer part of the shadow, a penumbral eclipse occurs.Traditionally Julys full moon is called a Buck moon because a bucks antlers are in full growth mode this period.\\xa0 According to Forbes, the Buck moon eclipse will see about 35 percent of the full Moon pass into the Earths outer shadow and lose some of its brightness.tags5 July5 July Chandra Grahan5 July Lunar Eclipse5 July Lunar Eclipse In IndiaChandra GrahanJuly 2020 Chandra GrahanJuly 2020 Lunar EclipseJuly Chandra GrahanJuly Lunar EclipseJuly Lunar Eclipse DateJuly Lunar Eclipse TimeJuly Penumbral Lunar EclipseLunar EclipseLunar Eclipse 2020Lunar Eclipse TimePenumbral Lunar EclipseFind latest and upcoming tech gadgets online on Tech2 Gadgets.

The vaccine candidate was developed in collaboration with the\\xa0Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and the National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune.The ICMR has selected 12 institutes across the country to carry out clinical trials of Covaxin and on Friday, urged the chosen clinical trial sites to expedite approvals and complete recruiting for the trails by 7 July, as per an internal letter from ICMR to the institutions.The letter also reportedly\\xa0said that Covaxin should be launched for public use by 15 August, however, Bharat Biotech spokespersons refused to comment on the statement.The letter by ICMR director general Balram Bhargava read, It is envisaged to launch the vaccine for public health use latest by 15th August 2020 after completion of all clinical trials. BBIL (Bharat Biotech International Limited) is working expeditiously to meet the target, however, final outcome will depend on the cooperation of all clinical trial sites involved in this project.Covaxin has been expedited through national regulatory protocols, and subjected to comprehensive pre-clinical studies according to the company, which reports that the results are promising and show extensive safety and effective immune responses.In the past, Bharat Biotech has manufactured the H1N1 vaccine during the swine flu outbreak and has over 140 global patents and 16 vaccines in its portfolio. The most significant of their developments is arguably the rotavirus vaccine Rotavac, a next-gen vaccine against viral gastroenteritis that got pre-approval from the WHO after an Oxford laboratory found it safe and efficacious.Firstpost spoke to Dr Ella about the development of Covaxin, the estimated cost, and the future course of action regarding the vaccine. Edited excerpts follow:What was the process of development of the vaccine, what were the various stages before Bharat Biotech approached CDSCO for approval for human trials?The virus strain was first isolated by the National Institute of Virology, Pune after it was collected by ICMR. This isolated strain was then used to develop a vaccine candidate at Bharat Biotech.Upon receipt of the virus strain from the NIV Pune, Bharat Biotech was able to quickly layout the GMP (good manufacturing practices) protocols for the manufacture of the vaccine candidate. Bharat Biotech took to develop the first set of GMP batches within 40 days and upon completion, the pre-clinical trials commenced.COVAXIN™ was evaluated in animals on Schedule Y Guidelines (Schedule Y defines the clinical trials as the requirements and guidelines for import and manufacture of new drugs for sale or for clinical trials. It describes the details of the application process for conducting clinical trials; responsibilities of the sponsor, investigators and the guidelines of Indias Independent Ethics Committee) and the World Health Organisation.COVAXIN™ was reported to be safe and immunogenic in all animals. We have now moved forward towards the clinical development of this vaccine.What are you expecting the vaccine to do based on your clinical trials so far? What are some of the key findings of the vaccine from your trials?Upon receipt of the virus strain from the NIV Pune, Bharat Biotech was able to quickly layout the GMP protocols for the manufacture of the vaccine candidate. Bharat Biotech took to develop the first set of GMP batches within 40 days and upon completion, the pre-clinical trials commenced. COVAXIN™ was evaluated in animals on Schedule Y Guidelines from India and WHO Guidelines. COVAXIN™ was reported to be safe and immunogenic in all animals. We have now moved forward towards the clinical development of this vaccine.Is it likely to be more effective in some people than others? How long is the vaccine likely to be effective?Conventionally, inactivated vaccines have been around for decades. Numerous vaccines such as seasonal influenza, polio, pertussis, rabies, and Japanese Encephalitis use the same technology to develop inactivated vaccines. Once the vaccine is injected into a human, it has no potential to infect or replicate, since it is a killed virus. It just serves the immune system as a dead virus and mounts an antibody response towards the virus.Which authority might be likely to decide the cost of the vaccine? If its Bharat Biotech, what is the estimated cost?As a socially inclined organisation and a company that is focussed on public health, we endeavour to deliver world-class vaccines at affordable prices. We have done this earlier and we hope to achieve the same even for COVAXIN™. We must say that it is too early to make any statement regarding the price.Coronavirus Updates:Students will be promoted to the next class without any examination but a decision on determination of marks will be taken in the next few days, said Technical Education Minister Subhash GargPIB uploads article claiming none of six Indian companies working on COVID-19 vaccine will have it ready before 2021, later removes mention of yearThe statement deleted from the article on PIB contradicted the Indian Council of Medical Researchs plan to launch a vaccine by 15 August this year.The ICMR envisages launching the vaccine for public health use by 15 August after completion of all clinical trials, as per a letter to institutions conducting trials.While the ICMR has said it is important to expedite the clinical trials for a promising indigenous vaccine in the public interest and that all other vaccine candidates across the globe have been similarly fast-tracked, scientists in one voice have cautioned against being over-optimisticOn the recommendation of MHA, MEITY has issued orders under Sec. 69 A of the I.T.

The injured will be given Rs 50,000 each.ICMR said that the letter by its director general Balram Bhargava to investigators of the clinical trial sites was meant to cut unnecessary red tape, without bypassing any necessary processThe Phase I and Phase II clinical trials of the vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, approved after pre-clinical studies demonstrated safety and immune response, would start across the country next month.Dr Anant Bhan, a researcher in global health, bioethics and health policy and former president of International Association of Bioethics, spoke to Firstpost about the extreme urgency shown by ICMR in developing Indias COVID-19 vaccine, COVAXIN, by 15 AugustA virologist said that a vaccine normally takes at least 12-18 months to pass all necessary clinical trial phases while the company developing it has just over a month to wrap up everythingWhile the ICMR has said it is important to expedite the clinical trials for a promising indigenous vaccine in the public interest and that all other vaccine candidates across the globe have been similarly fast-tracked, scientists in one voice have cautioned against being over-optimistic', '2020-07-03 12:28:29', 0.0, 9.899999618530273, '/Health/Medical Facilities & Services/Medical Procedures', 0.910000026, '/Law & Government/Public Safety', 0.899999976, '2020-07-05 20:36:31.244658', '2020-07-05 20:36:31.244660', 'Firstpost2020-07-03 12:28:29COVID-19 vaccine | Passed mandated protocols, animal testing and now in clinical development stage: Bharat Biotech#39;s Dr Krishna Ella', 'https://www.firstpost.com/health/bharat-biotech-has-passed-mandated-protocols-animal-testing-and-is-now-in-clinical-development-of-covid-19-vaccine-dr-krishna-ella-tells-firstpost-8555261.html'), (0, 'Firstpost', 'FP Trending', 'Amazon Prime Video desktop app for Windows 10 launched; will allow streaming, downloading videos for offline viewing', 'While it has always been possible to stream Prime Video content through browsers, with the desktop app users can now view content offline on Windows devices.', 'Best smartphones under 40KOnePlus 7T, iQOO 3 and moreMonday, July 06, 2020Back toSpacial secretsBig, hungry black hole devours one sun per dayHomeGadgetsMobilesLatest Mobile PhonesPopular Mobile PhonesUpcoming Mobile PhonesPopular CompareXiaomi Mobile PhonesSamsung Mobile PhonesVivo Mobile PhonesRealme Mobile PhonesOPPO Mobile PhonesMotorola Mobile PhonesNokia Mobile PhonesOnePlus Mobile PhonesApple Mobile PhonesLG Mobile PhonesHuawei Mobile PhonesAsus Mobile PhonesHonor Mobile PhonesSony Mobile PhonesGoogle Mobile PhonesHTC Mobile PhonesMicromax Mobile PhonesBlackberry Mobile PhonesLava Mobile PhonesLaptopsLatest LaptopsPopular LaptopsUpcoming LaptopsPopular CompareSony LaptopsToshiba LaptopsAcer LaptopsDell LaptopsLenovo LaptopsHP LaptopsAsus LaptopsMicrosoft LaptopsApple LaptopsSamsung LaptopsTabletsLatest TabletsPopular TabletsUpcoming TabletsPopular CompareSamsung TabletsMicrosoft TabletsApple TabletsMicromax TabletsSony TabletsLG TabletsHTC TabletsNokia TabletsKarbonn TabletsNewsReviewsAll ReviewsMobileLaptopAudioScienceAutoGamingPhotosVideosHow ToTechnology NewsNews-AnalysisAmazon Prime Video desktop app for Windows 10 launched; will allow streaming, downloading videos for offline viewingWhile it has always been possible to stream Prime Video content through browsers, with the desktop app users can now view content offline on Windows devices.FP TrendingJul 03, 2020 17:33:30 ISTAmazon has launched a desktop application for its Windows 10 users.
